It also converts from a `(context, target)` pair to an `((context, target_in), target_out)` pair for training with `keras.Model.fit`. Keras expects `(inputs, labels)` pairs, the inputs are the `(context, target_in)` and the labels are `target_out`. The difference between `target_in` and `target_out` is that they are shifted by one step relative to eachother, so that at each location the label is the next token."
